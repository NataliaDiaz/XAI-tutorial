Every XAI method is responsible to provide the right semantics to the triple `<subject, predicate, object>`. For example, the bars provided by the Lime explanator can be encoded with nodes having connections with the root (the output) and with their children that encode the numeric values associated with the features.\n",

Here we describe the basics of Pug and RosaeNLG, for a complete tutorial with advanced features see the main website [here](https://rosaenlg.org/rosaenlg/3.0.0/tutorials/tutorial_en_US.html).\n",

        "|Pay attention at your diet!\n",
        "```\n",

        "with output: \"You ate too much red meat.\" if `explanation.constraint` is `less` and `explanation.entity.enLabel` is `red meat`. Other values for these fields can lead to the following output: \"You did not eat enough vegetables.\" Notice that the use of the `#[+value()]` or the `!{}` notations is not allowed inside the `if`, `else` conditions.  \n",
        "\n",
        "### Redering Javascript code\n",
        "The Pug templates allow the writing of Javascript code. Here we just show the definition of simple variables that can be used in the template. Variables are defined with the following syntax:\n",
        "```\n",
        "- let variable_name = \"variable value\"\n",
        "```\n",

        "For loops are useful when inspecting an array field in the explanation. Loops are performed with the `eachz` operator from RosaeNLG:\n",

        "with output: \"Red meat contains animal lipids, animal proteins\". However, this sentence is not formatted in a proper English. It should have an \"and\" instead of the comma and should end with a dot. This can be correct by using [additional parameters](https://rosaenlg.org/rosaenlg/3.0.0/mixins_ref/eachz_itemz.html) supported by the `eachz` operator. The previous template can be modified as this:\n",
        "```\n",
